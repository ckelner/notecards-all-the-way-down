# Notecards all the way down

A recursive notecard app.

## Prototype

This was a low fidelity hacked together prototype to prove the concept for
my friend. It is now abandon, but serves a purpose as a proving ground for
the concepts put forth.

## Run

To run, simply open `index.html` in your browser.
